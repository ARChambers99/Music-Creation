# Music-Creation
This is a primitive python code that will allow use of Markov Chains to create chord progressions and melody lines in a pseudo-random fashion within a genre.
To use simply type repeat((starting chord),(number of chords),(genre)) and run code. The progressions start at zero so to start at tonic with 5 chords in blues the command would be repeat(0,4,blues).
